README for dyndnscd
===================

dyndnscd is the dyndns client daemon. It is a daemon that continually polls for
IP address changes an in the event of a change, triggers an IP address update.
It is somewhat configurable.

Downloading
-----------
You can find the latest version and the git repository of dyndnscd under the 
following URL: http://github.com/akrennmair/dyndnscd/

Dependencies
------------

dyndnscd is written in the fine programming language Go: http://golang.org/
In addition to the Go environment, you need goconf, which you can install in 
your Go environment by typing "go get github.com/akrennmair/goconf".

Installation
------------
Currently, there is no installation routine. Build it by running "go build" and run
it with "./dyndnscd -f yourconfigfile". The following section describes how to 
configure dyndnscd.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file is a .ini-style file. Every section defines the IP 
polling mechanism with a configuration key named "type" (allowed values: 
"device", "ipbouncer"). The "device" type regularly polls the IPv4 address of a 
network device (specified by the configuration key "device"), while the 
"ipbouncer" regularly polls the IPv4 address by calling a bouncer URL. A bouncer 
URL returns the client's IP address as the only content of the response body, 
and is configured with the configuration key "bouncer_url".

The URL update is configured with the configuraton key "update_url". Simply 
write "<ip>" (no quotes) where the client IP shall be inserted. dyndnscd will 
replace it by IP and will do a GET request on the resulting URL.

To configure the polling interval, use the configuration key "interval" (defines 
the minimum amount of seconds between two polling attempts).

Example 1:

	[dyndns-bouncer]
	type = ipbouncer
	bouncer_url = http://example.com/ip-bouncer
	update_url = http://username:password@members.dyndns.org/nic/update?hostname=example.dyndns.org&myip=<ip>&wildcard=NOCHG&mx=NOCHG&backmx=NOCHG

Example 2:

	[dyndns-eth0]
	type = device
	device = eth0
	update_url = http://example.com/?myip=<ip>

In addition, you can globally configure the log method. By default, dyndnscd 
logs everything to stderr. If you configure

	log_method = syslog

then dyndnscd will log to syslog instead.
